#### TypeScript Definitions

To be able to use libraries written in JS, you need to use these same TypeScript Definitions for them. And there is even
a whole open source project in which people write such definitions for popular projects. You can search and download
them on the site, or you can put a console utility that will simplify this process:

```npm install -g tsd```

With this utility, we will load the definitions for React and store the TypeScript definition entry in the tsd.json
file:

```tsd query react --action install --save```
