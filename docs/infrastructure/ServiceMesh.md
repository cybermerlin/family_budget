It's a network (mesh) of all your services through a special proxy (2016). You can use many services or you can create services such a proxy,
monitoring, SSR, any serverless services - all that would be aggregate into a network (mesh) which called Service Mesh.
To manipulate and monitoring these you can use additional service - service mesh controller. In the table bellow you can
see that as a proxy or side car instruments. They are transparent proxies to add functionalities of detection of
services, routing, working on declines\errors and accessibility in a cloud network.

Some people says about mTLS (mutual TLS) - that is the wrong name I saw first in 2020 year. Actually TLS provide
checking a Server Certificate AND an User Certificate. The Certificate checking can be on both sides at once time or on
a Client only. That means that firstly a Client system would check a Server Certificate and then a Server will check a
Client Certificate (if it was configured in a server application as required thing).
And this schema used to mutual authenticate and crypt the channel between users in SSL and TLS next.

And, No, mutual authentication should not be realized separately from a Web server (only when you planning to get some
experiments with your web servers or your application so big as a Java application). Actually, I used once (in ~2008) a
realizsation with the TLS as a separated server, because internal infrastracture should have been connected with users
only through the encrypted channel and it would be extra expensive pleasure to adopt all our servers to use GOST
Certificates.
But, we have a minus in this configuration - balancing task by geolocation is not solved , because the buttle neck will
be this TLS Server.

So, Service Mesh - it is about separation your Application and an Infrastructure. It give you balancing, caching,
monitoring, detecting of intrusions, and many tasks.
